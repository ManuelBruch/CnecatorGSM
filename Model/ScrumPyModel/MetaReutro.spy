# TOP-LEVEL MODULE
# This module combines all submodules into the GSM.
# Additional submodules, such as for heterologous pathways, can be included/excluded

# Note that we use the lumped biomass in our simulations so 'BiomassTrReacs.spy'
# is currently excluded. 'Carbon_sources.spy' which lists transporters for all
# tested carbon sources in the manuscript but are excluded from latter simulations
